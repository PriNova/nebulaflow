## High-level summary
This change set introduces a large number of NebulaFlow-specific workflow / node definition files (JSON) that describe a multi-agent, multi-stage workflow for planning, implementing, reviewing and documenting code changes.  
Only one “runtime” code change affects the shipped application: `WorkflowSidebar.tsx` now shows friendlier labels (“Agents”, “Text”) for two node categories by adding `displayCategoryLabel()`.

## Tour of changes
Begin with `workflow/Web/components/WorkflowSidebar.tsx`.  
It is the only file executed at run-time; understanding its small UI change tells us whether any regressions were introduced.  
Afterwards skim the new `.nebulaflow/**` JSON files to confirm they are purely configuration, spot-check a few security-relevant settings (`dangerouslyAllowAll`), and note duplication / maintenance risk.

## File level review

### `workflow/Web/components/WorkflowSidebar.tsx`
Changes
• Line 46+: add helper `displayCategoryLabel(type:string)` mapping  
```ts
const categoryLabels: Record<string,string> = {
  [NodeType.LLM]: 'Agents',
  [NodeType.INPUT]: 'Text',
}
```  
• Lines 303–306: replace raw `type` with `displayCategoryLabel(type)` when rendering group headers.

Review
1. Correctness  
   – If `NodeType` is an enum of strings (likely), computed property keys are valid.  
   – Unknown types fall back to the original string via `|| type`; good default behaviour.  

2. Typing  
   – `type` argument is declared as `string`; callers pass the object-key from `Object.entries(customNodesByType)` which is indeed a string. ✓  

3. Performance  
   – Function is recreated on every render. Minor, but could be hoisted with `const` outside the component to avoid re-creation. Existing placement already outside component (good).  

4. Internationalisation / UX  
   – Hard-coded English labels. If the app supports i18n, consider centralising the mapping.  

5. Tests  
   – No tests; but impact is visual only.  

No bugs detected; change is safe.

### `.nebulaflow/nodes/*.json` (18 files)
All new; each defines one NebulaFlow “node” (LLM call, text, preview). Main points:

• `timeoutSec: 0` is used widely to indicate “no timeout”. Confirm the orchestrator treats `0` as infinite and not as immediate cancel.  
• Several nodes set `"dangerouslyAllowAll": true`. This disables most tool sandbox restrictions. It should be restricted to trusted contexts only; otherwise a malicious prompt could trigger unwanted actions.  
• Many nodes disable `commit`, `edit_file`, etc. Good to limit write operations.  

Nothing blocks merge, but document the security implications of `dangerouslyAllowAll`.

### `.nebulaflow/workflows/full_implementation.json` & `full_workflow.json`
Define two composite graphs wiring the nodes together.

• Edge relationships appear consistent (JSON generated by a visual editor).  
• No cyclic dependencies detected.  
• The same “Code-Review” node definition is duplicated between `nodes` directory and workflow. Consider DRY to reduce drift risk.  

### Other newly added node JSON files
`Aggregate_Changes.json`, `Coarse_Planning.json`, `Fine-Grained_Planning.json`, etc. – configuration only, no execution code. Verify file naming is consistent; otherwise NebulaFlow may not auto-discover them.

### `WorkflowSidebar.tsx` (already reviewed)

## Recommendations
P3 – Security: review every `"dangerouslyAllowAll": true` flag. Remove or narrow scope where not absolutely required.  
P3 – Maintainability: deduplicate duplicated LLM prompt text (present in both node and workflow JSON) to avoid divergence.  
No blocking issues for merge.
