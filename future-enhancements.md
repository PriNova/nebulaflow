# Future Enhancements

Recommended improvements and optimizations for future implementation.

## Pending Enhancements

### Right Sidebar State Reset - Optional `executionRunId` Prop
- **Goal**: Improve ergonomics for `Flow` and `RightSidebar` components when used outside the `useWorkflowExecution` hook (e.g., tests, stories)
- **What**: Make `executionRunId` prop optional in `Flow` and `RightSidebar` components with sensible defaults
- **Why**: External consumers (test suites, Storybook stories) may not have access to `useWorkflowExecution` hook state, causing prop drilling complexity. Optional prop with default value simplifies integration.
- **Priority**: P2 (nice-to-have, improves developer experience for edge cases)

### Right Sidebar State Reset - Documentation of `executionRunId` Semantics
- **Goal**: Clarify the initialization and batching behavior of the `executionRunId` reset mechanism
- **What**: Add code comment or inline documentation explaining:
  - Why `executionRunId` is initialized to 0 on first mount
  - How React batching affects the order of reset effects vs. message posting
  - Why the reset effect checks `executionRunId > 0` before triggering
- **Why**: Future maintainers and contributors need clear understanding of the state management pattern to safely modify or extend the reset logic.
- **Priority**: P1 (improves maintainability; consider implementing alongside any follow-up fixes)
